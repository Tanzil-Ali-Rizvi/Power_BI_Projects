### **🔑 Key Insights & Deliverables**

1. **Optimized Ad Creative:** Visual analysis of “Engagements by Ad Type” and “Creative Fatigue Analysis” suggests that Video Ads outperform Image Ads in engagement, but conversion drops after 20 days, indicating creative refresh is needed.
2. **Targeted Platform Strategy:** Comparison across Facebook and Instagram reveals that Facebook drives higher impressions, while Instagram shows a stronger conversion rate among younger demographics, allowing for tailored budget allocation.
3. **Audience Refinement:** Insights from “Audience Insights by Gender & Age” and “Engagements by Country” highlight that a specific age group (25–34) and country (India) deliver the highest ROI, informing future campaign targeting adjustments.

**Deliverable:** An interactive Microsoft Power BI Dashboard providing a real-time view of Meta ad performance, enabling data-driven marketing decisions.
